Your portal to the circular economy
## Inspiration
This project was built as part of the Changemakers 2021 hackathon (see our [submission](https://devpost.com/software/re)). It was inspired by Doughnut Economics by Kate Raworth
## Design
Re will give you tips on how to repair, upcycle, and recycle the goods in your custody. This can be anything from your water bottle to your car. It was built using HTML and JavaScript for the code, and Figma and Adobe XD for the design
